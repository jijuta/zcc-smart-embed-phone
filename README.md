# Zoom Contact Center : React + Vite

This sample app uses Node.js + Express + React using Vite to build a Zoom Contact Center demo. The template used provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

## Prerequisites

1. [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started)
3. [Zoom Account](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/207278726-Plan-Types-)
4. [Zoom App Credentials](#config:-app-credentials) (Instructions below)
    1. Client ID
    2. Client Secret
    3. Redirect URI


## Getting started

Open your terminal:

```bash
# Clone down this repository
git clone https://github.com/zcc-react-demo

# navigate into the cloned project directory
cd zcc-react-demo

# run NPM to install the app dependencies
npm install

# initialize your ngrok session
ngrok http 3001
```



### Config `.env`

When building for Development, open the `server/.env` file in your text editor and enter the following information from the App Credentials section you just
configured:

```ini
# Client ID for your Zoom App
ZM_CLIENT_ID=[app_client_id]

# Client Secret for your Zoom app
ZM_CLIENT_SECRET=[app_client_secret]

ZCC_ENTRY_ID= [app_entry_ID ]

# Ngrok endpoint for your app in the Zoom Marketplace
PUBLIC_URL=https://[xxxx-xx-xx-xxx-x].ngrok-free.app


```

#### Zoom for Government

If you are a [Zoom for Government (ZfG)](https://www.zoomgov.com/) customer you can use the `ZM_HOST` variable to change
the base URL used for Zoom. This will allow you to adjust to the different Marketplace and API Base URLs used by ZfG
customers.

**Marketplace URL:** marketplace.*zoomgov.com*

**API Base URL:** api.*zoomgov.com*

## Start the App

### Development

Run the `dev` npm script to start in development mode using a Docker container.

```shell
npm run dev
```

The `dev` script will:

1. Watch React files and build to the dist/ folder
2. Watch Server files and build to the dist/ folder
3. Start the server and webpack dev server



### Keeping secrets secret

This application makes use of your Zoom App Client ID and Client Secret as well as a custom secret for signing session
cookies. During development, the application will read from the .env file. ;

In order to align with security best practices, this application does not read from the .env file in production mode.

This means you'll want to set environment variables on the hosting platform that you'
re using instead of within the .env file. This might include using a secret manager or a CI/CD pipeline.

> :warning: **Never commit your .env file to version control:** The file likely contains Zoom App Credentials and Session Secrets

### Code Style

This project uses [prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [eslint](https://eslint.org/) to enforce style and protect
against coding errors along with a pre-commit git hook(s) via [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/) to ensure
files pass checks prior to commit.

### Testing

At this time there are no e2e or unit tests.
